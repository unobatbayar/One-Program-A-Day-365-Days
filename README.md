# ProgrammingExercises

Solving programming exercises to learn and deepen main principles of computer science. All just for practice and learning.
The programming exercises are taken from jwasham/coding-interview-university and Cracking the Coding Interview, Codingbat and Hackerrank

All solutions were done on paper and later copied to our repository.

Great tip for solving programming exercises:

	Think and plan before doing anything
	
	Programming music might great for motivation and rush
	
Music from "The Social Network" "Mr Robot" "Tron" is a popular example of "getting things done" music.

	Often solutions that are correct are much simpler and easier than programmers think in their head

Have you ever felt how easy it was after checking the solution or solving the problem. Perhaps, practice is the best way
to improve, if you want to improve your programming in the large, you must be comfortable with programming in the small.
And only way to improve your programming in the small is to perfect any small problems with no limitation of programming languages.

	Python makes most problems way easier and faster to implement due to the less coding lines it requires.

# Most importantly everything has a flaw, challenge your answers!
