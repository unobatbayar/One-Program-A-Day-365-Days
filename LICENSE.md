Public Domain:

If your code is in the public domain, 
anyone may use your code for any purpose whatsoever. 
Nothing is in the public domain by default;
you have to explicitly put your work in the public domain if you want it there.
Otherwise, you must be dead a long time before your work reverts to the public domain.
